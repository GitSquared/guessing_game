\> "i should learn a new language, been messin' around with javascript for >2 years now"  
\> go to [stack overflow's 2018 survey results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)  
\> see rust is "most loved language" for 3 years in a row  
\> go to [rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org)  
\> low-level memory safe super blazing-fast open-source - *whatever, f\*cking take my soul already*  
\> grab the book, start reading, make a hello world, make the guessing game example  
\> upload it to github

### Current version includes:

* Try to guess a random number between 1 and 100!
* Beautiful CLI with colors and inline-prompts
* *emojis* :open_mouth:
* "autoguess": Let the computer play by itself (with gigantic numbers, while you're at it.)

### Future versions will include:

* modular architecture
* server/client interaction over the internet so you REALLY CAN'T CHEAT bcuz the random number will be stored on the other side of the world
* multiplayer with websockets
* something with databases. like, the mongo ones.

> Note: Of course all of this is ridiculous and pointless for a bloody guessing game, it's just for the sake of learning how to do these things i usually do in Node.js with Rust.
